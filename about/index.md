Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

## Notable Features

- Compatible with Jekyll 3.x and GitHub Pages
- Support for Jekyll's built-in Sass/SCSS preprocessor
- Several responsive layout options (single, archive index, splash, and paginated home page)
