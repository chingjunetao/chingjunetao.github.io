There was a time that I was afraid of SQL. I have no idea why I was afraid of it last time (Probably because of assignment?). Honestly, you can't escape from database in this era. You want to retireve data, you need database; You want to save data, you need database. Everything is in database. 

During my internship, I was asked to write SQL query to visualize the data. At that moment I knew that I can't escape from database if I choose data science as my career path. So, I changed my mindset and picked up SQL again, and I realized that SQL is not that hard. Even you do not have a programming background, you shouldn't be afraid of SQL because SQL is logical and intuitive. Most of the time, writing SQL query is easier than doing the same operation in Excel. 

Today I am going to share few of my favourtie sites to learn SQL. 

*What is SQL?*
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS). In another words, SQL is the language you use to interact with a database. 

Before learning SQL, you should study the basic concept of relational database management system (RDBMS). You should at least know what is a primary key and foreign key. These concepts are important to design and handle a database.

- [Mode Analytics SQL Tutorial](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/introduction-to-sql/)(This is my most favourite site to learn SQL because you don't have to setup database in your pc, you can run the query to access the database online.)
