I always wanted to create a blog after reading [Why you should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045). In fact I have created a blog by using Google Blogger few months ago. I didn't continue because Google Blogger doesn't provide me the flexibility and experience that I want. (Okay I know this is one of the reasons for me to be lazy) 

The good thing is I met [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Both of them provide me a good flexibility and customization for my personal blog. And the most important is they are FREE! But you will require some technical knowledge to set up because Jekyll is not as simple as Google Blogger. I have spend few days to set up this blog. 

Jekyll also provides tons of themes for you to customize your personal blog. I have chosen [Minimal Mistake Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes). I really like his theme especially the splash page provide by him. A huge thank goes to him! 

From now on I will try my best to summarise and blog my learning so that we can learn from each other. I will also review some food (mostly chocolate and dessert) on my blog. Do give me some feedback or correct me if I have made a mistake on my content or grammar. 

Have a nice day! Cheer! :kissing_smiling_eyes: (Oh ya the best thing is [emoji](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) is supported here! Who doesn't like emoji? :ghost: )
