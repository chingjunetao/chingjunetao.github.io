:milky_way: Landscape watercolour painting is always my favourite because my unconditional love toward nature. One thing I love about watercolour painitng because it does improve my patience. Most of the time I screw up my drawing is because of my impatience lol. <br/><br/>


# Life Quote 
What I like about water colour painting is you can always correct your mistakes and make it right. <br/>
It is same with our life. Maybe you screwed up your early life, but you can always work hard to fix it, and get a better life :muscle:
