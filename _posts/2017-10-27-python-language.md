The first time I came across with Python was in a subject called Numerical Method. I was asked to write a python script to do numerical analysis and compute differential equation. That time I thought Python is just another programming language similar to R. I didn't know Python is so useful in scraping data, data analysis and machine learning. Now, I am totally falling in love with Python because of its awesome library and clean syntax.

Today I am going to share my favourite resources that I used to learn Python.  

- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

 In this book, you can learn the fundamental of programming such as data structure, string manipulation and debugging. As what the book named, you will also learn how to use Python to write programming that do in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand-no prior programming experience required.

 I learned how to manipulate my excel spreadsheet and file in this book.

- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

 Second book, Python Data Science Handbbook is not meant to be an introduction to Python. You should be familiar with Python language or completed the first book that I recommended. It is meant to help Python users understand more on Python's Data Science stack-libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.

 It is a great book for someone who want to learn Data Science by using Python language!
