The last time I went to Genting was about 5 years ago (Damnnn time flies...). This year I finally got a chance to go to Genting because of my business trip. <br/> 
Due to the delay of 20th Century Fox theme park contruction (I knew it!! I doubt they will complete that in 2018 :sweat_smile::sweat_smile:), the things we can do in Genting are only shopping and gambling. In order to make our business trip memorable, my colleagues and I decided to try the famous Burger and Lobster.

The left hand side is the member price, you will automatically become a member as long as you have the Genting Reward Card. The card is free to register. The price is in Ringgit Malaysia (MYR).

You should try this if you are a beef lover. The main attraction of this burger is the beef (they said it is 168g of premium beef from Stanbroke, Australia) but not the lobster (the lobster is very small, smaller than my thumb :joy::joy:). Too bad I can't try it because I don't take beef. But my colleagues said the beef is really nice and juicy.

The Original Lobster is available in steamed and grilled. They are served with the signature lemon and garlic butter sauce.

The last one is is my most favourite, the legendary Lobster Roll. It is available in 3 different sauces: The Chilli, The Original (with Japanese mayonnaise) and Seven Samurai (with seven spices sauce). You can expect a satisfying burst of flavour and texture in every bite, thanks to the great combination of lobster meat and the sauces :yum::yum:  <br/>

**Verdict** <br/>
Overall : :heart::heart::heart:  <br/>
Lobster Rolls are the must try for me! <br/>
I believe that Malaysia has plenty of options to taste the lobster with a cheaper price. But if you are a lobster fan, Burger and Lobster is a great place to visit, if only to try the famous brand.
