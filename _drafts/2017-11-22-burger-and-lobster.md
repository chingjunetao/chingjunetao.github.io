[Lady M Confections](http://www.ladym.com.sg/) was the brand that started the popular mille crepe cake craze back in 2005. Singapore was one of the countries that Lady M expands out of New York. I managed to try it out in Westgate, Jurong East. <br/>

Their best-selling mille crepe cake is still top draw at the Singapore outlet. But as a chocoholic, chocolate cake is always the first thing I try in a cafe :yum::yum:

Gateau Au Chocolat has a good chocolate flavour and it is not that sweet because of its dark chocolate ganache. Its alternating layers of dark chocolate sponge cake and chocolate mousse provide smooth and silky texture. Overall, it is very satisfying! <br/>

Its Signature Mille Crepes lives up to the fame. Twenty paper-thin crepes layered with ethereal ight pastry cream provides a unique texture. This is a must try for every cake lover! <br/><br/>




**Verdict** <br/>
Overall : :heart::heart::heart::heart:  <br/>
I definitely will go back to try out other cakes especially the checker board chocolate cake and green tea mille creeps.
